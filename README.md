# Electrical-Science-A
This is a personal project dedicated to summarising all the teaching material developed in the context of Electrical Science A.
Most recent update: Jan 2025
Aims:

To introduce students to the basic laws, theories and theorems concerning electromagnetic induction and the analysis of linear
electrical circuits.


## Intended Learning Outcomes:

On completion of the module, students should be able to:
(1) Knowledge and Understanding
- Analyse and predict the steady-state electrical response of linear DC and AC electrical systems (1-phase and 3-phase).
- Analyse and predict the transient response of first-order electrical systems consisting of resistors and inductors or resistors and capacitors.
- Calculate magneticfield strength, magnetic flux and electromagnetically induced voltages in simple geometries.
- Analyse and predict the output response of ideal iron-core transformers to an AC input signal.
(2) Skills and Attributes
Subject-specific skills
(i) Intellectual/cognitive skills
- Apply basic mathematical techniques used in Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Electromagnetism at a level sufficient to analyse simple electrical and electromagnetic problems.
(ii) Practical
- Set-up working DC and AC circuits in the laboratory, take measurements and interpret them.
- Use computational tools for simulating the behaviour of DC and AC electrical circuits.
- Make order of magnitude estimates of key quantities occurring in practical electromagnetic problems.
3. Key/Transferable skills
- Take notes during lectures.
- Record a lab log.
